# Design Prompt
## Description
Server APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. My challenge this week was to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

I used the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data for cities.

I used `localStorage` to store any persistent data. 

User Story:
```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria
Your project must fulfil the following requirements<a href="#references">*[1]*</a>:
* Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.
  * When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
  * When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
    * The city name
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
    * The wind speed
  * When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
  * When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## Mock-Up
The following image shows a mock-up of the generated HTMLâ€™s appearance and functionality:

![The weather app includes a search option, a list of cities, and a five-day forecast and current weather conditions for London.](./assets/img/10-server-side-apis-challenge-demo.png)

The styling in the image is just an example, so feel free to add your own.<a href="#references">*[1]*</a>
